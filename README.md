# RsPass - CLI Password Manager

A secure command-line password manager written in Rust, featuring encryption and safe memory handling.

## Features

- **Secure Storage**: Passwords are encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- **Key Hashing**: Master password is hashed with Argon2
- **Simple CLI**: Easy-to-use command-line interface
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux

### What RsPass Does NOT Do

- **No Cloud Sync**: Vault is stored locally only
- **No Interface**: Command-line only (working on graphical interface)
- **No Browser Integration**: Manual copy/paste is required

## Installation from Source

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd rspass
cargo build --release
```

The binaries will be available at `target/release/rspass`. They should remain in the same directory.
| Binary      | Description          | Path                       |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `rspass`    | Command-line tool    | `target/release/rspass`    |
| `rspass-ui` | Graphical UI version | `target/release/rspass-ui` |


## Storage Location

Vault files are stored at:
- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.rspass/vault.enc`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.rspass\vault.enc`


## Usage

### Initialize a New Vault

```bash
rspass init
```

Creates a new encrypted password vault. You'll be prompted to set a master password.

### Add a Password

```bash
# Interactive (prompts for password)
rspass add github

# With password as an argument (less secure - visible in shell history)
rspass add github --password mySecretPassword123
```

### Retrieve a Password

```bash
rspass get github
```

### List All Services

```bash
rspass list
```

### Update a Password

```bash
# Interactive (prompts for password)
rspass update github

# With password as an argument (less secure - visible in shell history)
rspass update github --password newPassword456
```

### Remove a Password

```bash
rspass remove github
```

### Launch UI versoin of RsPass

```bash
# Launching the UI app from the CLI app
rspass ui

# Directly launching the UI app
rspass-ui
```

## Disclaimer

This is a personal project. While it follows strong security practices, it has not undergone professionally security testing or auditing. For production use, consider established password managers like 1Password, Bitwarden, or KeePass.
